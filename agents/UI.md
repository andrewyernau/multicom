This agent evaluates and maintains UI/UX consistency across the project, ensuring that every interface element aligns with the defined design system and accessibility standards.  
It generates mockups or wireframes based on existing components, detects redundancies or inconsistencies in XAML or Blazor files, and validates visual coherence such as dark mode, color palette, and typography usage.  
Integration with style and accessibility checkers ensures a user experience that is both cohesive and inclusive.
